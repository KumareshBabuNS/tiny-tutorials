# Tiny Tutorials

We work with lots of tools and they can be combined together in many interesting ways.

Some tutorials are examples of ways Stark & Wayne has helped clients' become elegantly effective. Others are pull requests from you!

Each subfolder includes a standalone tiny tutorial. Each tiny tutorial might also expand on, or lead to other tiny tutorials.

## Submitting tiny tutorials

Please submit tiny tutorials as pull requests to the `master` branch.

Include the tutorial in a `README.md` file.
